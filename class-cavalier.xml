		<description>
			<p>A gleaming knight in full plate charges the enemy from atop his noble steed. His lance pierces the enemy combatant, throwing them off their feet. The horse nimbly dodges past the enemy before circling around to make another pass.</p>
			<p class="indent">A Halfling rides atop their Giant Spider, stalking their enemies from the ceiling of a cave. The poor goblin didn't even hear them coming before they pounced, seizing the initiative. A soldier is riding atop their war mount, a Wyvern, high above the battlefield. The duo swoop down, wrecking havoc on the enemy ranks, tearing through the opposition with fervor and zeal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Cavalry is a useful asset in combat. Mounted combat has existed nearly as long as war itself, and has evolved greatly over the expanse of time. From heavily armored units backing the flanks of legionaries, to steppe raiders raining arrows, to devastating charges of shock cavalry, mounted units can easily sway the course of a battle with intense power and speed.</p>
			<h4>COMBAT IN UNISON</h4>
			<p>The one thing all riders have in common is the bond they share with their mounts. A rider needs to establish their knowledge of how their mount behaves, and hone their ability to control it in tense situations. Without a mount to ride, the rider loses their edge over the enemy. A rider must take good care of their steed and protect them if possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">A rider typically names their mounts, grooms them, and adorns them with protective barding to ensure the mount's survival.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A CAVALIER</h4>
			<p>As you create your cavalier, consider how they came upon their mount. Many mounts can be hard to come by, and even some of the more common ones can fetch a sizable sum. Did they find their mount's egg and has raised it since birth, gaining trust from an otherwise hostile creature? Does your cavalier come from a position of privilege, and was granted their mount by their wealthy family or lords? Was your character a soldier for an army and after defecting and becoming a deserter took their steed with them?</p>
			<p class="indent">As well, consider what type of bond your cavalier will share with their mount. Is it just a mindless creature under your servitude? Is it more of a pet, that you interact with more closely? Maybe you even live in a symbiotic nature with your mount.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a mystic quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Soldier background. Lastly, pick Lancer as your Cavalry Wing.</p>

			<p>A Wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison Stinger. The poison in a wyvern's Stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, Wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and Adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat Weapons.</p>
